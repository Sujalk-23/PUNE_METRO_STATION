# PUNE_METRO_STATION
Metro Ticket Booking System allows users to book tickets  for a metro network that includes a total of 14 stations 
It is a simple C++ program that will take information (name) of the source station and the destination station, of Pune Metro, from the user and display the fare and shortest metro route to reach the destination. it will also have aditional feature like time required for journey.

The idea is implemented using Graph data structures.
By using different algorithms like Dijkstra, breadth-first search, depth-first search, etc, the shortest path between the source station and the destination station is determined, and accordingly, the fare is being calculated on the basis of the total distance between the two stations. Finally, the metro route between the two stations and the total fare is displayed.
